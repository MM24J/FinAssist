## 50/30/20 Rule
Allocate 50% needs (rent, utilities), 30% wants (restaurants, entertainment), 20% savings/debt payoff.

## Lowering restaurant spend
- Set a weekly cap and track it.
- Meal prep 2 lunches/wk to cut impulse orders.
- Move coffee/fast food into a shared "Dining Out" cap.

## Groceries vs. Dining
- Groceries up + dining up → overbuying & eating out. Plan meals, shop with list.
- Groceries up + dining down → home cooking trend; check waste/spoilage.

## Mobile & Internet Bills
- Call the provider every 6-12 months for promo pricing.
- Bundle or auto-pay discounts can save 5-15%

## Emergency Fund
- Target 3-6 months expenses. Automate transfers the day after payday.

## Credit Card Payments
- Treat as transfers; don't double count as spend.

## Variance Interpretation
- Variance = Actual - Budget. Positive = over-budget; negative = under.
- Largest positive variance categories are best savings targets.

## Investment Basics
- Diversified index funds for long horizons.
- Compare 1y return to SPY as a quick benchmark.
