## 50/30/20 Rule
- Allocate ~50% of income to **needs** (rent, utilities).
- Allocate ~30% to **wants** (restaurants, entertainment).
- Allocate ~20% to **savings/debt payoff**.

## Lowering restaurant spend
- Set a weekly dining cap and track it.
- Meal prep 2 lunches per week to cut impulse orders.
- Move coffee/fast food into a shared "Dining Out" cap.

## Groceries vs. Dining
- Groceries up + dining up → overbuying & eating out. Plan meals, shop with a list.
- Groceries up + dining down → home cooking trend; check waste/spoilage.

## Mobile & Internet Bills
- Call the provider every 6–12 months for promo pricing.
- Bundle or auto-pay discounts can save 5–15%.

## Emergency Fund
- Target 3–6 months of expenses in cash savings.
- Automate transfers the day after payday.

## Credit Card Payments
- Treat payments as transfers; don’t double count as spend.

## Variance Interpretation
- Variance = Actual − Budget. Positive = over-budget; negative = under.
- Largest positive variance categories are best savings targets.

## Investment Basics
- Use diversified index funds for long horizons.
- Compare 1-year return to SPY as a quick benchmark.
